# Game history

August 6th 1945,

The bomb "Little Boy" fell on Hiroshima, destroying everything in it's sight.
But some people were lucky enough not to be there on the day of the bombing...
And after all these years, he finally came back to do the right thing.

In this puzzle game, help an old man heal and let his dead family members pass on to the other side...
Dodge evil Yokai, move mirrors, and let the light your loved ones.
